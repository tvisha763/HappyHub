Hi,

It looks like {{user.fname}} had a bad week!😭 We would like if you checked in with them. If you like, you can reply to this email with an update on how they are doing. We hope things get better for them!💜 In addition, try to get them to relax, and do something that they enjoy or spend time with the people they love.❤️

Thank you and have a happy day,
💜Happy Hub
